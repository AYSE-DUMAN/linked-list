# Linked List in C 

This project was part of a school assignment focused on understanding and implementing linked lists using the C programming language. A linked list is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment was to implement various operations on a singly linked list, including:

## Code Structure

- **Node Structure:**
   Each node has a `data` field and a `next` pointer pointing to the next node in the list.
   
- **Functions:**
   - `insert_at_beginning()`
   - `insert_at_end()`
   - `insert_at_position()`
   - `delete_node()`
   - `reverse_list()`
   - `display_list()`
   - `search_node()`
